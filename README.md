# GC Ethereum smart contracts

The GC contracts implements ERC20 compliant tokens:
* GC Network Token (GC) is a virtual currency used to purchase . 

Users get points through the game center, and mining gets points assets on the chain. They can use GC DAO to exchange tokens into basic values in the GC. Contracts expose smart regulations, which means that all transactions comply with smart contract requirements
